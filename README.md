# DashBoard_React
In this dashboard, we have used React and Chart.js to visualize the data of products returned by an API. The dashboard displays a list of products, along with their respective details such as ID, title, description, price, discount percentage, rating, stock availability, brand, category, thumbnail image, and other images.

We have also utilized TailwindCSS to create a responsive layout for the dashboard, which provides an optimal viewing experience on different screen sizes.

To enhance the visual appeal of the dashboard and provide more insights into the data, we have included two charts. The first chart is a line chart that displays the stock availability of each product, allowing users to quickly identify which products are low on stock.

The second chart is a pie chart that displays the distribution of categories among the products. This chart provides a visual representation of which categories have the most products and can be useful for inventory management and product planning.

Overall, this dashboard provides a clear and concise view of the product data, making it easy for users to quickly understand the information and make informed decisions based on it.
